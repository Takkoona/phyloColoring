WARNING: The number of threads is currently set to 0
You can specify the number of threads to run via -T numberOfThreads
NumberOfThreads must be set to an integer value greater than 1

RAxML, will now set the number of threads automatically to 2 !


RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file
